## This is a very _Easy_ and highly _Accurate_ **Restaurant** **Tip** **Calculator**
##### https://github.com/Evanet123/class_projects/blob/main/tip_calculator_challenge.py


#### As the user, there are only six(6) inputs of information required. Once you receive the restaurant's check, at the end of your dinner services, locate these specific (4) amounts: 
 
  1. restaurant check subtotal; 
  2. restaurant tax total; 
  3. restaurant check grandtotal, and 
  4. how many people are splitting the check. 

#### When prompted, please enter the requested data you have just located in the appropriate space. 
------------------------------------------------------------
### **Let's begin!**

The _first_ prompt will request the restaurant check's subtotal. When entering that amount, please input a single amount in the form of a numerical value such as '0.00', providing decimal spaace between dollars and cents (dollar sign is unnecessary). 

The _second_ prompt will request the restaurant check's total tax amount. When entering that amount, please input a single amount in the form of a numerical value such as '0.00', providing decimal spaace between dollars and cents (dollar sign is unnecessary).

The _third_ prompt will request the restaurant check's grandtotal amount. When entering that amount, please input a single amount in the form of a numerical value such as '0.00', providing decimal spaace between dollars and cents (dollar sign is unnecessary).

The _fourth_ prompt will request the total number of individuals you are splitting the check with. When entering that number, please inputa a single amount in the form of a numerical value such as: ('1,2,4,10, etc). 

The _fifth_ prompt will request your desired tip/gratuity amount. When entering that number, please input a single amount in the form of a numerical value such as: ('5,10,15,20, etc) no percent '%' sign necessary. 

The _sixth_ prompt will request that you review the information that you have input into the Tip Calculator, and confirm that it is correct. If data is correct, indicate so by typing 'correct' (no quotation marks necessary). If data is incorrect, you can type any other key. 

### Once you have confirmed that all of the information is correct, the **Tip Calculator** will automatically provide you with: 
  1. the restaurant check's calculated grandtotal amount per person (subtotal + tax), 
  2. the restaurant check's calculated tip amount per person,  
  3. the restaurant check's calculated grandtotal amount per person, and 
  4. a clarifying statement indicating how much each person splitting the check should pay!

  ### **YAY!**
